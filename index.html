        "Hye-Eun  has the gift of calming and relaxing her patient, a wonderful ability in this contemporary
        neurotic world.  She listens very attentively, no matter how serious or trivial the problem might be.
        She can stop a cold dead in its tracks and is extremely good at alleviating aches and pains,
        whether rheumatic, arthritic or from pulled muscles.

        She has a very sympathetic and friendly approach and I am sure anyone would unhesitatingly recommend her"<br />
